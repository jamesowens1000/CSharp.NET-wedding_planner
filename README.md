# Assignment: Wedding Planner
Create a web app that allows registered users to plan a wedding. Visitors can RSVP to weddings and view attendee lists.

    Objectives:

        • Connect a Login/Registration to application that depends on a logged-in user
        • Get practice building out your own database from wireframe
        • Continued practice with many-to-many SQL tables/Entity Framework models (hint: this app will necessitate many-to-manys!)
